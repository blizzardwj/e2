Supporting code for "Edge exchangeable models for network data"

Three files:

1. [functions.R](functions.R): Contains all functions used inmodel
fitting and simulations.
2. [simulation.R](simulation.R): Contains simulation from the
Hollywood model. Then fitting procedures via SBM and ERGM.
3. [actors.R](actors.R): Model fitting and subsampling procedures
related to actors network. Additional information on actors
network can be found [here](http://www3.nd.edu/~networks/resources/actor/actor.dat.gz).
3. [airport.R](airport.R): Model fitting procedure for airport network. Additional information on
airport network can be found [here](https://toreopsahl.com/datasets/).
